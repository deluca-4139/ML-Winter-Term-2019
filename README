Machine Learning Winter Term
Domenick De Luca, Oberlin College c/o '21
January 2019

All code written by myself as part of a personal research project done during Winter Term (J-Term) at Oberlin College in January of 2019.

Some code is better annotated that others, and some is more functional than others. 

All problems here use either AI Gym (gym.openai.com) or NMIST as their source.

acrobot_dqn.py ~ attempt to use Deep Q Learning (DQN) to solve the cartpole problem.
acrobot_main.py ~ copy of cartpole_main.py using the acrobot problem instead, non-functional.
cartpole_dqn.py ~ using DQN to solve the cartpole problem.
cartpole_main.py ~ using a Tensorflow (TF) neural network to solve the cartpole problem.
frozen_lake.py ~ using Q learning to solve the frozen lake problem. Functional, but does not solve.
mnist_fashion_main.py ~ using supervised learning to fit a model to the MNIST fashion database.
nchain.py ~ using Q learning to solve the NChain problem.
taxi.py ~ using Q learning to solve the taxi problem.
